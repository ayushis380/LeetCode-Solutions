# LeetCode-Solutions
LeetCode is one of the best platforms to practice coding. Coding is fun, and consistency is the key. My goal is to solve at least 5 LeetCode questions per day. I use the LeetHub extension, which automatically uploads my solutions on GitHub. Now I can track my progress and consistency.
